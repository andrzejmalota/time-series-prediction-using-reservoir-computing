PROJECT TARGET:
    - input data is stock prices / exchange rates with minute / hourly freq
    - build stock price (close) prediciton model using reservoir computing models and compare it to statistical models
    - project results in 'fake paper'
    - finish by the end of december


TODO:
    DATA:
        - different companies's stock prices,
        - different data frequency (1, 5, 15, 30, 60 minutes),
        - different sliding window size,
        - different prediction horizon, t-steps ahead,
        - firstly try out raw OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data, can experiment later with feature engineering,

    MODEL:
        - different reservoir computing models, Echo State Network (ESN), Liquid State Network (LSN),
        - different statistical models ARIMA, PROPEHT
        - different reservoir initialisation strategies,
        - different reservoir regularization strategies,
        - different results agregation,
        - sth holdout?

    METRIC:
        - RMSE
